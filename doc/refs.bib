  abstract={The abilities of organisms to sequester substrate are described by the two kinetic constants specific affinity, a degrees, and maximal velocity Vmax. Specific affinity is derived from the frequency of substrate-molecule collisions with permease sites on the cell surface at subsaturating concentrations of substrates. Vmax is derived from the number of permeases and the effective residence time, tau, of the transported molecule on the permease. The results may be analyzed with affinity plots {(v/S} versus v, where v is the rate of substrate uptake), which extrapolate to the specific affinity and are usually concave up. A third derived parameter, the affinity constant {KA,} is similar to {KM} but is compared to the specific affinity rather than Vmax and is defined as the concentration of substrate necessary to reduce the specific affinity by half. It can be determined in the absence of a maximal velocity measurement and is equal to the Michaelis constant for a system with hyperbolic kinetics. Both are taken as a measure of tau, with departure of {KM} from {KA} being affected by permease/enzyme ratios. Compilation of kinetic data indicates a 10(8)-fold range in specific affinities and a smaller (10(3)-fold) range in Vmax values. Data suggest that both specific affinities and maximal velocities can be underestimated by protocols which interrupt nutrient flow prior to kinetic analysis. A previously reported inverse relationship between specific affinity and saturation constants was confirmed. Comparisons of affinities with ambient concentrations of substrates indicated that only the largest a {degreesS} values are compatible with growth in natural systems.}

  abstract={The oxygen-consuming processes in the hypolimnia of freshwater lakes leading to deep-water anoxia are still not well understood, thereby constraining suitable management concepts. This study presents data obtained from 11 eutrophic lakes and suggests a model describing the consumption of dissolved oxygen {(O(2))} in the hypolimnia of eutrophic lakes as a result of only two fundamental processes: O(2) is consumed (i) by settled organic material at the sediment surface and (ii) by reduced substances diffusing from the sediment. Apart from a lake's productivity, its benthic O(2) consumption depends on the O(2) concentration in the water overlying the sediment and the molecular O(2) diffusion to the sediment. On the basis of observational evidence of long-term monitoring data from 11 eutrophic lakes, we found that the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate ranging from 0.47 to 1.31 g of O(2) m(-2) d(-1) (average 0.90 {\&\#xB1;} 0.30) is a function of (i) a benthic flux of reduced substances (0.37 {\&\#xB1;} 0.12 g of O(2) m(-2) d(-1)) and (ii) an O(2) consumption which linearly increases with the mean hypolimnion thickness {(z(H))} up to {\textasciitilde}25 m. This model has important implications for predicting and interpreting the response of lakes and reservoirs to restoration measures.},

  abstract={We examined the factors that determine the citations of 153 mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical modeling papers published from 1990 to 2002. Our analysis provides overwhelming evidence that ocean modeling is a dynamic area of the current modeling practice. Models developed to gain insight into the ocean carbon cycle/marine biogeochemistry are most highly cited, the produced knowledge is exported to other cognitive disciplines, and oceanic modelers are less reluctant to embrace technical advances (e.g., assimilation schemes) and more critically increase model complexity. Contrary to our predictions, model application for environmental management issues on a local scale seems to have languished; the pertinent papers comprise a smaller portion of the published modeling literature and receive lower citations. Given the critical planning information that these models aim to provide, we hypothesize that the latter finding probably stems from conceptual weaknesses, methodological omissions, and an evident lack of haste from modelers to adopt new ideas in their repertoire when addressing environmental management issues. We also highlight the lack of significant association between citation frequency and model complexity, model performance, implementation of conventional methodological steps during model development (e.g., validation, sensitivity analysis), number of authors, and country of affiliation. While these results cast doubt on the rationale of the current modeling practice, the fact that the Fasham et al. (1990) paper has received over 400 citations probably dictates what should be done from the modeling community to meet the practical need for attractive and powerful modeling tools.},

Several methods have been used by microbiologists, biotechnologists, and environmental engineers. This manuscript illustrates that these formulations are related. Yields predicted by estimation of Gibbs energy of dissipation and yields predicted by assumed efficiency of energy capture are comparable. Direct comparison of yield predictions from different methods shows the effects of assumptions inherent in the methodologies. Mathematical relationships between estimated values from the different methods help identify the best predictions from each method to bound the estimate of bacterial yield.},

  abstract={Denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of N oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions. The process is an essential branch of the global N cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life. Discovered more than a century ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas. Important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have been achieved with Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paracoccus denitrificans, Ralstonia eutropha, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms. Around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus. Much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established. The activation and enzymatic transformation of N oxides is based on the redox chemistry of Fe, Cu, and Mo. Biochemical breakthroughs have included the X-ray structures of the two types of respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means. This revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases. Denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme D1. An important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater {FNR} family. Nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct N oxide-metabolizing enzymes.}

  abstract={Mathematical modelling in environmental biotechnology has been a traditionally difficult resource to access for researchers and students without programming expertise. The great degree of flexibility required from model implementation platforms to be suitable for research applications restricts their use to programming expert users. More user friendly software packages however do not normally incorporate the necessary flexibility for most research applications. This work presents a methodology based on Excel and {Matlab-Simulink} for both flexible and accessible implementation of mathematical models by researchers with and without programming expertise. The models are almost fully defined in an Excel file in which the names and values of the state variables and parameters are easily created. This information is automatically processed in Matlab to create the model structure and almost immediate model simulation, after only a minimum Matlab code definition, is possible. The framework proposed also provides programming expert researchers with a highly flexible and modifiable platform on which to base more complex model implementations. The method takes advantage of structural generalities in most mathematical models of environmental bioprocesses while enabling the integration of advanced elements (e.g. heuristic functions, correlations). The methodology has already been successfully used in a number of research studies.},

  abstract={Patterns of aerobic methane {(CH4)} oxidation and associated methanotroph community composition were investigated during the development of seasonal stratification in Mono Lake, California {(USA).} {CH4} oxidation rates were measured using a tritiated {CH4} radiotracer technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization {(FISH),} denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis {(DGGE)} and sequence analysis were used to characterize methanotroph community composition. A temporally shifting zone of elevated {CH4} oxidation (59-123 {nM} day(-1)) was consistently associated with a suboxycline, microaerophilic zone that migrated upwards in the water column as stratification progressed. {FISH} analysis revealed stable numbers of type I (4.1-9.3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and type {II} (1.4-3.4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) methanotrophs over depth and over time. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis indicated slight shifts in methanotroph community composition despite stable absolute cell numbers. Variable {CH4} oxidation rates in the presence of a relatively stable methanotroph population suggested that zones of high {CH4} oxidation resulted from an increase in activity of a subset of the existing methanotroph population. These results challenge existing paradigms suggesting that zones of elevated {CH4} oxidation activity result from the accumulation of methanotrophic biomass and illustrate that type {II} methanotrophs may be an important component of the methanotroph population in saline and/or alkaline pelagic environments.},
